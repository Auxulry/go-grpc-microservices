# ca.key: Certificate Authority private key file (this shouldn't be shared in real-life)
# ca.crt: Certificate Authority trust certificate (this should be shared with users in real-life)
# server.key: Server private key, password protected (this shouldn't be shared)
# server.csr: Server certificate signing request (this should be shared with the CA owner)

# Private files: ca.key, server.key, server.pem, server.crt
# "Share" files: ca.crt (needed by the client), server.csr (needed by the CA)

# Changes these CN's to match your hosts in your environment if needed.

# Step 1: Generate Certificate Authority + Trust Certificate (ca.crt)
openssl genrsa -passout pass:1111 -des3 -out ${KEYS}/ca.key 4096
openssl req -passin pass:1111 -new -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -key ${KEYS}/ca.key -out ${CERTIFICATES}/ca.crt -subj "/CN=ca"

# Step 2: Generate the Server Private Key (server.key)
openssl genrsa -passout pass:1111 -des3 -out ${KEYS}/server.key 4096

# Step 3: Get a certificate signing request from the CA (server.csr)
openssl req -passin pass:1111 -new -key ${KEYS}/server.key -out ${CERTIFICATES}/server.csr -subj ${MY_SUBJECT}

# Step 4: Sign the certificate with the CA we created (it's called self signing) - server.crt
openssl x509 -req -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:${SERVER_CN}") -passin pass:1111 -sha256 -days 365 -in \
    ${CERTIFICATES}/server.csr -CA ${CERTIFICATES}/ca.crt -CAkey \
    ${KEYS}/ca.key -set_serial 01 -out ${CERTIFICATES}/server.crt

# Step 5: Convert the server certificate to .pem format (server.pem) - usable by gRPC
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -passin pass:1111 -in ${KEYS}/server.key -out ./ssl/server.pem
